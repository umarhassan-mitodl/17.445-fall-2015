## Course Overview

This page focuses on the course _17.445/17.446 International Relations Theory in the Cyber Age_ as it was taught by Professor Nazli Choucri in Fall 2015.

This course examined cyber dynamics and processes in international relations from different theoretical perspectives. It considered alternative theoretical and empirical frameworks consistent with characteristic features of cyberspace and emergent transformations at all levels of international interaction. Theories examined included realism and neorealism, institutionalism and liberalism, constructivism, and systems theory and lateral pressure. The course also highlighted relevant features and proposed customized international relations theory for the cyber age.

Students taking the graduate version were expected to pursue the subject in greater depth through reading and individual research.

### Facilitating Active Seminar Participation

One requirement of _17.445/17.446 International Relations Theory in the Cyber Age_ is that students actively participate in seminars. To facilitate productive and engaging classroom discussions, I ask questions. When students offer responses, I follow up see if there are objections from others or if clarification is needed. Asking students to share their views is key — and I would recommend that other educators leading seminars try to do this.

I've learned that too much lecture without opportunities for students to engage in discussions about the various topics does not support active seminar participation.

I've also asked students not to use laptops in class. Not using laptops seems to help students focus on our conversations.
